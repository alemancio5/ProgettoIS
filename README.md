## ProgettoIS

Final project for the bachelor's degree in "Ingegneria Informatica" at Politecnico di Milano. The project involves the reproduction of a table game called My Shelfie. This repository is not the official one for the project, but rather a publication repository. The project was developed with three colleagues: Flavia Nicotri, Stefano Morano, and Chiara Nguyen Ba.

## Usage

1) Run ServerApp.java to start the RMI and socket servers.
2) Run ClientApp.java as many times as the number of players (maximum of four).

## Notes

This is an unofficial repository, so the project deliverables are not available.
